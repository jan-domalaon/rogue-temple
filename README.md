Many thanks to [GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ) and the various tutorials and open source projects hosted there. Props to [Game Endeavor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLweX1UtQjRjj7rs_0XQ2Eg) and [KidsCanCode](http://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/g101/) as well for their Youtube tutorials and Godot Recipes. I wouldn't have gotten this far if it wasn't for their content.

### ANNOUNCEMENT AUGUST 2020
We will be doing a revision of various systems before heading back into development, hopefully by September 2020. The systems we plan on revising are:
* Scene transitions
* Mob AI and the state transitions
* Weapon interaction hitbox and damage hitbox
* Rewriting of how character movement is handled
* Probably more than this. I had this code for almost 2 years and there's bound to be smelly bits 

*No new features or changes will be added until these systems are revised. Or at least we can say it is good to do so*

### Current features as of August 2020
* Melee, ranged weaponry system. Includes pierce, blunt, cut damage - each with unique properties
* Damage blocking using a shield
* Basic mobs with knockback
* Humanoids with ranged and melee AI
* Inventory system
* Level/scene furniture, such as doors, pits, spiked traps
* Basic saving

### Planned Features in no particular order
* A boss fight
* More traps, mobs, levels, weaponry
* More polish with UI
* Fog of war

### Tools used
* Godot Game Engine 3
* GDScript
* Git
* Paint.NET
* Photoshop
